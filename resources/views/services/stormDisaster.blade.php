                                    Storm damage should be addressed as soon as possible. Prompt repairs prevent further
                                    damage, such as water intrusion and mold growth. Quick action also helps secure your
                                    property and protect it from potential safety hazards.

                                    It depends on the extent of the damage. Minor repairs may not require you to leave your
                                    home, but significant structural damage or water intrusion might make it unsafe to stay.
                                    Professionals can provide guidance based on the severity of the situation.

                                    Preventative measures include regular roof inspections, maintaining gutters and
                                    downspouts, reinforcing windows and doors, and trimming trees near your property.
                                    Installing storm shutters and securing outdoor furniture can also help minimize damage
                                    during a storm.
