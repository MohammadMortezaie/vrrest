                                Almost everything can be destroyed by fire, which is disastrous. Also Smoke and soot can be
                                toxic, creating a hazardous situation for yourself and your property. Even if a fire is
                                isolated in one location, smoke and soot can spread throughout a building. We realize how
                                upsetting fire and smoke damage may be.
